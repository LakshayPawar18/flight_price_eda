# ✈️ Flight Price EDA

This project explores flight fare data to identify the key factors influencing airline ticket prices. Using Python's powerful data science stack — Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib — the notebook performs thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual analysis. Categorical features such as airlines, stops, and routes are transformed using OneHotEncoding to prepare the data for future modeling tasks.

> 📌 This is an exploratory project. Please contact me for more Information.
